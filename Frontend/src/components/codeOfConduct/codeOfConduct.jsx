                    <h2>Our Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Scope</h2>
                    <p>
                        This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
